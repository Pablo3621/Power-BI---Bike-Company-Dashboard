AdventureWorks, a company specializing in bicycles and sports equipment, has experienced significant international growth in recent years. As business analysts, our aim is to develope an interactive Power BI dashboard using data from the AdventureWorks database to:

 - Analyze financial trends and evaluate the company’s overall performance.

 - Identify the most successful products and determine which ones generate the highest profitability.

 - Profile customers and explore their characteristics, behavior, and spending patterns.

This project was developed as part of the course “Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence” from Maven Analytics.
